    <h3>Personal Objectives</h3>
        <p>
            To learning the building blocks of making basic web pages: <strong> HTML and CSS.</strong> And to also focus on using the command line and Git to create a daily workflow for our coding projects.
            The end game in this RPA training is to ensure im able to automate the route works which most of the time are repeatative and time consuming. i lookforward to a great week 2 to cement what we have learnt in week 1.
